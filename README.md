# Portfolio Overview

Welcome to my portfolio of client-side web applications. This collection showcases projects focused on security, utility, and data management, all designed to run directly in your browser for enhanced privacy and control.

## Projects

Below is a list of projects currently available. Each Cybersecurity project is client-side, ensuring your data remains private and under your control. The hobby-projects will alert you when storing server side info. All of these projects can be downloaded and run offline. Thank you for checking me out and drop me an email if you have any projects you'd like to work on together!

### 1. nCode - Secure Client-Side Encryption Tool

*   **Description:** nCode is a comprehensive web application for robust client-side encryption and password management. It allows you to encrypt and decrypt text strings and files using strong AES-GCM encryption. A key feature is "Goldhash" verification, which helps ensure data integrity and correct password usage. nCode also includes a deterministic password generator and a secure transmission module for exchanging encrypted data using RSA public/private key pairs. All operations are performed in your browser, and no data is ever sent to a server.
*   **Key Features:** String encryption/decryption, file encryption/decryption, Goldhash integrity verification, password generation, secure data transmission via RSA key pairs.
*   **Learn More:** [nCode Project README](./Projects/nCode/README.md)

### 2. GoldHash - Client-Side File Integrity Monitor

*   **Description:** GoldHash is a file integrity monitoring tool that operates entirely within your browser. It helps you detect unauthorized changes to your important local files. You can add folders from your computer, and GoldHash will calculate and store cryptographic hashes (SHA-256) of the files within them. Subsequent scans compare current file hashes against the stored versions, highlighting any modifications, new files, or deletions. It features an activity log, statistics on file changes, and a visual graph of modifications over time.
*   **Key Features:** Local folder monitoring, SHA-256 hashing for integrity checks, detection of modified/new/deleted files, activity logging, file change statistics, client-side operation.
